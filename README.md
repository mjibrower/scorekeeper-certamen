This is the code for my ScoreKeeper app for the Udacity Android Basics class. It tracks two team scores for a game called Certamen. It's a team game similar to Quiz Bowl, but with questions about Latin and classical culture (Roman history, mythology, etc.). It's mostly played by high-school and college Latin students. Each round has 20 questions ("toss-ups"). Players buzz in or slap the table (depending on how hi-tech the venue is ;-) ) to answer the toss-up question. If a team gets the toss-up question right, they get 10 points and a bonus question. If they get that question right, they get 5 points and another bonus question (which also earns 5 points).
